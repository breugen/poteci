  // What if someone removes a column, your application would
  // not be working properly, because it assumes that there are
  // three columns returned and the logic to process those three columns would be broken.
  // If someone adds more columns, your application may work
  // but it gets more data than needed, which creates more I/O overhead between the database and application.
  // So try to avoid using the asterisk (*) as a good habit
  // when you use the SELECT statement.
